# Brain Parcellation Survey: Evaluation Code
This repo holds the evaluation code (mainly written in Matlab) used in the brain parcellation survey "Human brain mapping: 
A systematic comparison of parcellation methods for the human cerebral cortex", in which a large-scale and systematic 
comparison is carried out between the state-of-the-art connectivity-driven, anatomical, and random parcellation methods. 

Please cite the corresponding paper (if using the code) as:

## Usage

Simply follow in-file instructions. Reading the _Data_ and _Experimental Setup_ sections in the article may also 
help understand the code better.

## Data
Generation and evaluation of parcellations are carried out using the publicly available datasets from the Human Connectome 
Project (HCP). Some functions may be dependent on the HCP data structures and require you to download certain files. 
However, each script can also be adapted to any other dataset, by following the steps throughout the codes. If you would like 
to use the HCP data, it can be downloaded from https://db.humanconnectome.org
